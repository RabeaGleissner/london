##Dealing with difficult questions
+ Set expectations upfront on whether you’ll have time to answer questions
+ If you’re super nervous at the end of the talk, it’s ok to say ‘I’m sure you’ll appreciate, it’s pretty nerve-wracking to be up here so I won’t be taking any questions from the stage but come find me after’
+ Can you clarify for everyone what x y and z mean to make sure everyone’s on the same page?
+ If people don’t ask any questions, always take things in the best possible way (it’s ok to not get questions, you must have answered all of their questions)
+ It's ok to say you don't know, but point people in the direction of who does

##Preparing a talk
+ Recommends Presentation Patterns
+ Find 3 big things you want to impart and build your talk around those

##Practicing a talk
+ Everyone has different ways of preparing
+ 5 min talk is more about just checking you're not going crazy over time
+ Longer talks - practice at least once out loud
+ **Live demos:** Practice out loud quite a few times
+ **Tips:**
  + Try out your talks at meetups that film you and watch it back _(hint: LWC London will have optional recording of talks from April 2015 onwards!)_

  + Co-presenting is a really great way to get started

_Tip for eye contact:_ Scan the crowd - you don't really have to make eye contact

Titles should be super catchy or buzz-word filled. Also indicate a level
If the CfPs aren't blind

Other topics:
+ Book club - 5 mins teaching or talking through something that you struggled with

How can you tell if people are paying attention? Usually you can tell. Body language relatively relaxed, people are looking engaged

Tips on speaking slower: Don't be afraid of silence, it's ok to stop. For a 50 minute talk, try to have max 40 mins of content so you're forced to slow down.

Be yourself. **If none of this works for you, do _exactly_ what feels comfortable. No more, no less**

+ Get someone to take a short video of you when you're comfortable and talking to your friends, then figure out what you're doing with your hands and mimic that
+ Remember people aren't in your head, don't worry about that one example you forgot to mention - no one else knows!
+ Repetition is good - it'll be awkward for you, but it's positive!
