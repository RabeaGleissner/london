#Ladies Who Code LDN | [December 2015](http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Who-Code-UK/events/226673924/)

In honor of the festive season, Ladies Who Code is partnered with [Codebar](http://www.codebar.io), [24 Pull Requests](http://www.24pullrequests.com) and [YourFirstPR](http://yourfirstpr.github.io/) for a special day of contributing to open source projects. 

It was a wonderful day with lots of fantastic ladies and gents showing up at Twitter HQ in London to spend the day giving little gifts of code.

We started off the day with 3 lightning talks:
